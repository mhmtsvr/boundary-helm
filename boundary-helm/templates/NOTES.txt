Thank you for installing HashiCorp Boundary with Community Chart!

Now that you have deployed Boundary, you should look over the official docs here:

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}. To learn more about the release, try:

ℹ️ To retrieve the initial credentials after deployment, run:

  $ kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=boundary-init -n {{ include "boundary.namespace" . }} --tail=-1

This will display the admin username, password, and other initial configuration details.
